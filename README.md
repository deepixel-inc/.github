# Deepixel: Real-time Visual Intelligence Solutions

## Who We Are

Deepixel is a visual intelligence deep-tech startup based on **computer vision** and **machine learning** for the development of real-time recognition and tracking technology for human body parts such as a face, hands, body, feet, etc. We are expanding try-ons and creating new human digital experiences from full body understanding, which can be applied to an interactive interface for the emerging spatial computing.

## Core Capabilities

Our proprietary AI vision technology runs in real-time and is mobile-optimized for accurate tracking using only input from a single camera. Our specializations include:

*   **Pose Estimation & Body Parts Detection:** Precise identification of key body joints in 2D and 3D space, forming the backbone of our systems.
*   **Face Tracking & Landmark Detection:** Advanced algorithms for reliable tracking of facial regions and 6D pose estimation, even with occlusions or angle changes.
*   **Wrist and Hand Tracking:** Granular detection for interactive applications and augmented reality experiences.

## Projects & Repositories

Explore our public repositories to see our work in action. We are creating innovative digital experiences through solutions like StyleAR, an AR virtual try-on and AI personal shopper solution.
