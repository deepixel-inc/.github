## About Deepixel

**Deepixel** is a visual-intelligence deep-tech startup based in **Seoul, South Korea**, specializing in **real-time human understanding algorithms** using a **single RGB camera**.

We design and optimize proprietary **computer vision** and **machine learning** pipelines that perform robust **3D pose estimation**, **high-precision landmark detection**, and **temporal tracking** across **mobile and web environments**.

Deepixel operates a **fully in-house vision R&D stack**, covering **raw data acquisition**, **custom annotation pipelines**, **deep learning model design and training**, and **platform-specific optimization**. This end-to-end ownership allows us to tightly couple data, models, and inference pipelines, ensuring **algorithmic efficiency, stability, and accuracy under real-world constraints**, and enabling solutions that are precisely tailored to the needs of each vision problem and deployment platform.
